1. I did not know anything about web design or coding before this class so yes I learned lots! Now I think I am pretty cool that I can make websites, I always show my friends.

2. Yes I did learn about design as well, it was always really fun to me to pick what colors to use and trying to figure out the best design patter to make my website look clean but still fun!

I used everything I learned throughout the semester to create this page. I of course took advantage of the atom an github apps on my computer and used moodle as well.
