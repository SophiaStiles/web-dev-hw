1. I have come across both text forums and button inputs. In the text forum I am not sure what it was for but you had to write one word in the area provided that makes you happy. The button inputs are all over and they are basically always asking what thing you like best out of how many ever options.

2. Text forums may be used when you are being asked a free response question in a survey. Selection and button input would be used to have someone chose a specific item out of a list of options, might be used in a survey asking what flavor you like best.

3. For this assignment I watched the walk through video and read the instructions on moodle. I also used atom and the github desktop apps to help me get the assignment done in an easier fashion.
