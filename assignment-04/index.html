    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <h2>Robert Frost</h2>
    <hr />
    <pre>Some say the world will end in fire,

Some say in ice.

From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire

I hold with those who favor fire.

But if it had to perish twice,

I think I know enough of hate

To say that for destruction ice

Is also great

And would suffice.</pre>
