1. Divs allow us to divide the page into groups of related elements. Ids allow us identify what type of information is within the div. Class tags allow us to easily style the div. Spans allow extra styling within a div only to one particular area of the div without affecting anything else.

2. Alt text describes a particular image embedded in the page. It allows a screen reader who may be visually impaired to be able to accurately understand an image that is being described to them. 

3.For this project I watched the walkthrough video and followed the instructions provided on moodle. I also used the github and atom apps on my computer.
