    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>You've been here before, surrounded in the cold<br>
    You take me to places I've never known<br>
    And you push me to places I'll never go<br>
    I would die for you<br>
    Tell me the truth<br>
Am I all that you would need?<br>
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me<br>
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you<br>

But you got me shot down by love<br>
You got my heart now<br>
Why won't you stop now?<br>
Oh I've been knocked down by you<br>
You got my heart now<br>
Why won't you stop now?<br><br>

I've been through it whole<br>
I've been through the worst<br>
But I never knew how much our love could hurt<br>
Over my family I put you first<br>
Riding on my feelings is the only thing that work<br>
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too<br>
But I hold on to the poems I would write you<br>
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three<br>
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku<br><br>

You got me shot down by love<br>
And you got my heart now<br>
Why won't you stop now?<br>
Oh I've been knocked down by you<br>
And you got my heart now<br>
Why won't you stop now?<br>

Knocked down, knocked down<br>
Knocked down, knocked down<br>
Knocked down<br>
Knocked down<br>

I've been shot down by love<br>
You got my heart now<br>
Why won't you stop now?<br>
I've been knocked down by you<br>
And you got my heart now<br>
Why won't you stop now?</p>
