1. Honestly I knew nothing before this class about html. So this class has kind of been challenging because it is a lot of new information. I have enjoyed learning though and think it is really fun. I am now able to add tables, add images, and make lists. Basically I could not do anything before and now I can make a website.

2. Once again I know nothing about CSS so I am excited to learn everything you will teach us.

3. My work load is the same as always. I looked on moodle for the instructions and watched the walkthrough. I also used atom and git hub desktop to help complete the assignment with ease.
